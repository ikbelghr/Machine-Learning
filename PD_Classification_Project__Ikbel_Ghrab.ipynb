        "# Introduction\n",
        "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease . The prevalence of PD is 1% among people over the age of 60 years and 4% among those over the age of 80 years . Approximately one to two people out of every 1,000 suffer from PD . The number of PD patients is increasing in parallel with the increase in the elderly population. Globally, the number of PD patients has doubled between 1990 and 2015, with approximately 6.2 million individuals affected . Since 1990, the age-standardized prevalence rate (ASR) increased by 21.7% .\n",
        "\n",
        "Early detection and treatment are important for patients with PD. There is no reliable diagnostic test currently, and PD identification is based primarily on clinical criteria . **Traditionally**, the early diagnosis of PD is based on interviews with the patient followed by careful neurological examinations. So far there is no intelligent computing approach collecting different symptoms for speeding up the diagnosis of the disease. Telediagnosis and telemonitoring approaches **recently** introduced represent non-intelligent methods for diagnosing PD and these systems are unable to solve complex problems based on data-intensive learning. It could therefore be useful to develop automated systems to help in the early diagnosis of PD.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Machine learning (ML)** has been extensively used in a variety of applications requiring data collected in some specific format. Data-intensive problems can be solved using statistical models and learning-based solutions. Healthcare applications have also successfully adopted these approaches.\n",

        "# **Conclusion**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scaling has the most significant effect on KNN**, where it leads to a substantial improvement in mean accuracy. This is because **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** is a distance-based algorithm. It relies on calculating the distance between points  to classify them. If features are on different scales, features with larger ranges dominate the distance calculation, leading to biased results. Scaling standardizes all features to the same range, ensuring that no single feature disproportionately affects the model's performance, resulting in more accurate classifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **AdaBoost** is relatively **insensitive to scaling**, with a small improvement when unscaled. AdaBoost works by combining multiple weak learners (typically decision trees), and its performance mainly depends on the ability of these learners to identify complex patterns in the data. Since decision trees are not distance-based and are insensitive to feature scaling (they partition data based on feature thresholds), scaling has little to no effect on AdaBoost's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Random Forest** shows **minimal variation** in performance between scaled and unscaled data, with a slight edge when unscaled. Similar to AdaBoost, **Random Forest** is based on decision trees, which are not affected by the scale of the features. Trees split the data based on feature values and not on distances, so scaling doesn't significantly impact their ability to partition the data. The slight difference observed may be due to inherent randomness in the forest and how it handles the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Best Model for Parkinson's Disease Classification**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Based on the **mean accuracy**, **Random Forest** performed the best in classifying Parkinson's disease with a mean accuracy of **84.34%** in the unscaled condition, which is slightly higher than the other models. Its ability to aggregate results from multiple decision trees helps improve performance by reducing overfitting and capturing a broad range of patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Overall Summary**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **For KNN**, scaling is essential due to the distance-based nature of the algorithm, where unscaled features can lead to incorrect distance calculations.\n",
        "- **For AdaBoost and Random Forest**, scaling has minimal or no impact because both are tree-based algorithms that are not influenced by the scale of the features.\n",
        "- **Random Forest** performed the best in the classification task, making it the most effective model for Parkinson's disease classification in this analysis.\n"
